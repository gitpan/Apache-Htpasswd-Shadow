NAME
    Apache::Htpasswd::Shadow - Apache::Htpasswd variant that saves to a
    different file

DESCRIPTION
    The Apache::Htpasswd provides an interface to Apache *.htpasswd*-style
    files.

    However, it saves changes to the .htpasswd file directly, which assumes
    that you actually have write permission to the file.

    In many cases, particularly when modifying accounts from a web interface
    on that same Apache instance, you would never want the web user to have
    the sort of permissions needed to change the file.

    In these cases, it is instead preferred to have the web user write to a
    "shadow" version of the .htpasswd file. This shadow version is then
    examined and copied into place by a process with suitable permissions
    that is trigged by the web user, or runs at regular intervals.

    The Apache::Htpasswd::Shadow module implements this concept.

METHODS
    With the exception of the additional new parameter, the interface for
    Apache::Htpasswd::Shadow is identical to Apache::Htpasswd. See that
    module for interface documentation.

  new
      # Single-param version
      $htpasswd = Apache::Htpasswd::Shadow->new("name-of-file");
  
      # Multiple-param version
      $htpasswd = Apache::Htpasswd::Shadow->new({
              passwdFile => 'name-of-file',
              shadowFile => 'name-of-shadow-file',
              ReadOnly   => 1,
              UseMD5     => 1,
       } );

    The new constructor takes the same parameters in the same way as the
    regular Apache::Htpasswd new constructor.

    The one exception is that it allows you to pass the additional named
    parameter shadowFile to explicitly specify the name of the shadow file.
    If not provided, the default shadow file name is the same as the
    passwdFile value, but with '.new' appended.

SUPPORT
    This module is stored in an Open Repository at the following address.

    <http://svn.ali.as/cpan/trunk/Apache-Htpasswd-Shadow>

    Write access to the repository is made available automatically to any
    other CPAN author, and to most other volunteers on request.

    If you are able to submit your bug report in the form of new (failing)
    unit tests, or can apply your fix directly instead of submitting a
    patch, you are strongly encouraged to do so as the author currently
    maintains over 100 modules and it can take some time to deal with
    non-critical bug reports or patches.

    This will also guarentee that your issue will be addressed in the next
    release of the module (since my release automation won't let me release
    a module with broken tests) :)

    If you cannot provide a direct test or fix, or don't have time to do so,
    then regular bug reports are still accepted and appreciated via the CPAN
    bug tracker.

    <http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=Module-Inspector>

    For other issues, for commercial enhancement or support, or to have your
    write access enabled for the repository, contact the author at the email
    address below.
